## 📝 Project Overview
This is a single-page resume website built entirely with **pure HTML** as part of the **Web Development Cohort 2026**. The goal of this assignment was to practice semantic HTML tags, table structures, and lists without using any CSS. It represents my first step in building a professional digital presence for my business ventures in Ayodhya.

---

## ✨ Features
* **Semantic Structure:** Uses tags like `<header>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` for better readability and accessibility.
* **Data Tables:** Professional experience and education details are organized using clean HTML tables.
* **Clean Layout:** Utilizes horizontal rules (`<hr>`) to separate sections like "About Me," "Skills," and "Projects" for visual clarity.
* **Contact Information:** Includes active email links and localized contact details.
